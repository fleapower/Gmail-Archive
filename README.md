# Gmail-Archive
Archives your Gmail into a text file in your Google Drive.  Attachments are maintained in a separate directory.  Attachment names are listed in each text email.

To use this script, just past the code into a new Gmail script file.  The only variable which needs to be changed is the year at the beginning of the script.
